Algorithmic trading (also called automated trading, black-box trading, or algo-trading) uses coded functions to implement well defined sets of instructions to place trades. This project helps to experiment with python code and theory behind these concepts.  
  
cli.py is a command line tool that simply grabs price data and displays graphs and KPIs using past historical data for a stock ticker. No prediction or trading.  
  
stocks.py is a bunch of code that groups many useful features together (eventually a package).  

Many platforms exist on the Web to automate trading, this project is not intended to replace any of them.  
  
This repo is free to fork or download, but has no value as an investment tool. Please do your own research and consult a financial advisor before buying or selling any stocks.  
   
## Data sources experimentation
` yfinance ` python package to extract from the decommissioned Yahoo data API  
` pandas_datareader ` pyhton package to extract data from multiple sources  
` mplfinance ` python pakkage to plot chart data
